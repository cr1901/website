<a href="http://wellcomecollection.org/feminineaspect" target="_blank">Feminine Aspect</a>, my latest Twine work, is now available via the Wellcome Collection~<br/>
<br/>
also I was very annoyed by the Supreme Court refusing to hear <a href="https://storify.com/alicemazzy/here-is-why-granting-oracle-copyright-on-the-java-" target="_blank">Oracle v. Google</a> so I made <a href="https://twitter.com/jajlang" target="_blank">a bot</a> that takes stuff from the Java API and swaps out as many words as possible for synonyms<br/>
<br/>
also also I have a new website now (hi). I still have to add stuff and it's prolly broken in a bunch of places but it says "under construction" at the bottom so it's against the law to criticize me for it
