			<dd>this site now supports tls. yay! shoutout to the good folks at <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">letsencrypt</a>, truly they are doing the work of the goddess</dd>
			<dd>note that presently git only works over http. alas, nothing I can do until my subdomains are whitelisted. for now I've just set https to git to 403, but if you happen upon a scary browser warning, that is why</dd>
			<dd>ideally I will have a 1.0 of twistor up and running in a week or two. I migrated this site to a new host yesterday, and setting this server up takes care of most of what I'd need to do for that project</dd>

			<dd>current project: <a href="http://git.alicemaz.com/public/?p=twistor.git;a=summary">twistor</a>, a site that archives and makes publicly viewable deleted tweets from politicians, and a small set of programs that enables others to do likewise with arbitrary twitter feeds</dd>
